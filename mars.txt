Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.
Matt Damon was stuck here for a while. 
He grew potatoes from his own poop.
He really should have brought a dog.
The dog would be more interesting than TV.
The dog may have figured out how to get home faster.
Also, should have brought drugs.
I think the first entertainment that should be brought to Mars is dirt bikes.
