Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.
Matt Damon was stuck here for a while. 
He grew potatoes from his own poop.
He really should have brought a dog.
The dog would be more interesting than TV.
The dog may have figured out how to get home faster.
Also, should have brought drugs.
I think the first entertainment that should be brought to Mars is dirt bikes.D
How long will it take us to adapt to Mars' environment?
Would you eat rocks or would you eat flesh?
It will probably take us longer to get there than to adapt to it.
